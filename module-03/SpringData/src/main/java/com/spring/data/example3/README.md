Template Design pattern:
* Is a behavioral design pattern which allows to encapsulate algorithm or main flow, in a way to achieve customization and code reusability
* It is achieved by creating a abstract class which contains the algorithm or main flow, the subclasses provide the implementation/customize for the steps in the main flow
* It is used to achieve code reusability. However since it is using inheritance it limits the flexibility.
* Consider Strategy Design pattern which will give similar result. This uses Composition over inheritance
