Callback
* A callback is a code or reference to the code that is passed as an argument to the method. This method will execute passed callback during execution.
* In Java we cannot directly pass method as an argument to another method, we use interface or functional interfaces(lambdas) to simulate callback
* In Java callback can be:
  * Class that implements interface
  * Anonymous class
  * Lambda expression
  * Reference method
