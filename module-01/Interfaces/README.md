Interfaces
* Is a description of actions that objects can do.
* It also enforces the actions on objects that implement them.
* It is also used a reference type, which contains abstract methods.
* All class which implements this interface has to provide implementation for those methods.
* If not it needs to declare the methods as abstract.
* Interfaces can contain: Constants(static final), default methods, static methods, private methods

Advantages:
* Decoupling between objects and implementation
* Ease testability
* In spring helps in easily switching beans
